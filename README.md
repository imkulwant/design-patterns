3. Facade
4. [Factory](factory/README.md)
5. [Observer](observer/README.md)
6. [Strategy](strategy/README.md)

## OO Basics

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
  - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) can be simplified into three key guidelines:
    - Use abstractions instead of concrete classes for variables.
    - Inherit from abstract classes or interfaces rather than concrete classes.
    - Avoid overriding implemented methods in base classes
