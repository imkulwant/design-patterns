## The Decorator Pattern
- This design pattern allows us to add new behaviors/functionalities to an object without modifying its structure.
- We add new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the new behaviors. 
- It's like wrapping a gift with different layers of paper to enhance its appearance without changing the gift itself.


## Structure of the Decorator Pattern
- The Decorator Pattern consists of four main components:
  - **Component**: This is the interface that defines the methods that can be implemented by concrete components and decorators.
  - **Concrete Component**: This is the class that implements the `Component` interface. It is the class that we want to add new behaviors to.
  - **Decorator**: This is the abstract class that implements the `Component` interface and contains a reference to the `Component` interface. It is the class that contains the new behaviors that we want to add to the `Concrete Component`.
  - **Concrete Decorator**: This is the class that extends the `Decorator` class and implements the new behaviors that we want to add to the `Concrete Component`.
